        concept: "If there's no continuity of self, karmic actions would lack a bearer, leading to moral chaos—actions by one affecting another randomly. This reinforces dependent origination, where karmic continuity exists without an inherent self.",
        quantum: "Quantum error correction: In quantum computing, information is preserved despite errors, ensuring continuity, similar to how karma persists through dependent arising. The quantum no-cloning theorem prevents copying quantum states, yet information remains preserved through redundancy and error correction.",
        simple: "Like a cloud backup saving your files even if your computer crashes, karma ensures actions have consequences, even without a fixed 'you' to carry them.",

        text: "There is no occurrence from what has not occurred. In that case faults would follow: the self would be something made or even though it occurred it would be uncaused.",
        concept: "Rejects creation ex nihilo (something from nothing) and inherent existence. The self cannot arise without causes nor be uncaused, pointing to dependent origination as the middle way.",
        quantum: "Vacuum fluctuations: Particles briefly arise from 'empty' space due to quantum uncertainty, governed by laws, not uncaused, mirroring the self's conditional arising. These fluctuations follow the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, allowing energy to briefly 'borrow' from the vacuum.",
        simple: "Think of a bubble popping up in boiling water—it doesn't come from nowhere; heat causes it. Similarly, the self arises from conditions, not from nothing or by itself.",

        concept: "All four extreme views about the past self—existence, non-existence, both, or neither—are invalid, assuming inherent existence. The tetralemma points to emptiness beyond conceptual extremes.",
        quantum: "Quantum measurement: Before measurement, a particle's state is superposed (neither here nor there), collapsing upon observation, like the indeterminate past self. This wave function collapse illustrates how quantum systems exist in multiple potential states simultaneously until interaction.",

        quantum: "Particle stability: Protons are stable (like the divine), while neutrons decay (like humans). Equating them ignores fundamental differences, as does equating divine and human. The half-life of isolated neutrons (about 15 minutes) demonstrates their inherent impermanence compared to practically eternal protons.",

The tunneling process allows particles to penetrate barriers that would be insurmountable in classical physics, with probability decreasing exponentially with barrier width.",

        quantum: "Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC): At near absolute zero, atoms behave as a single quantum entity, neither fully particle nor wave, challenging classical distinctions. When cooled to nanokelvin temperatures, individual atoms lose their identity and form a coherent macroscopic quantum state with new emergent properties.",

        quantum: "Quantum superpositions: Entangled states defy classical categories, existing in a superposition that isn't simply 'this or that,' akin to emptiness transcending dualities. Bell's inequalities demonstrate that quantum correlations cannot be explained by classical hidden variables or predetermined properties.",

Virtual particle pairs near the event horizon cause one particle to fall in while the other escapes, gradually reducing the black hole's mass until complete evaporation.",
