        text: "Cut off and actions wasted, acts committed by others would be experienced by someone else. Such would be the consequences.",
        explanation: "Like a cloud backup saving your files even if your computer crashes, karma ensures actions have consequences, even without a fixed 'you' to carry them. This is similar to quantum error correction in computing, where information is preserved despite errors, ensuring continuity, just as karma persists through dependent arising.",

    },
    {
        number: "Verse 12",
        text: "There is no occurrence from what has not occurred. In that case faults would follow: the self would be something made or even though it occurred it would be uncaused.",
        explanation: "Think of a bubble popping up in boiling water—it doesn't come from nowhere; heat causes it. Similarly, the self arises from conditions, not from nothing or by itself. This mirrors quantum vacuum fluctuations where particles briefly arise from 'empty' space due to quantum uncertainty, governed by laws, not uncaused.",
        title: "Conditional Arising"
    },
    {
        number: "Verse 13",
        text: "Therefore, 'the self occurred, did not occur, both or neither:' all those views of the past are invalid.",
        explanation: "Like Schrödinger's cat, neither alive nor dead until checked, your past self isn't fixed—it's indeterminate until 'observed' through memory or karma. This reflects quantum measurement, where before observation, a particle's state is superposed (neither here nor there), collapsing only upon measurement.",
        title: "Invalid Past Views"
    },
    {
        number: "Verse 14",
        text: "'I will occur at another time in the future,' 'I will not occur:' all those views are similar to [those of] the past.",
        explanation: "Imagine a weather app showing a 50% chance of rain—it's not certain. Your future self is like that: a possibility, not a definite 'will' or 'won't' be. This parallels quantum prediction, where future particle states are probabilistic, not fixed, until measured, just as the future self is shaped by present conditions.",
        title: "Future Indeterminacy"
    },
    {
        number: "Verse 15",
        text: "If the divine were human, then there would be something permanent. The divine is utterly unborn, because there is no birth in permanence.",
        explanation: "A rock doesn't grow like a tree; they're different. Similarly, the divine (unchanging) can't be the same as humans (changing)—change and permanence don't mix. This is like particle stability: protons are stable (like the divine), while neutrons decay (like humans), showing fundamental differences between permanence and change.",
        title: "Permanence vs. Change"
    },
    {
        number: "Verse 16",
        text: "If the human were other than the divine, then there would be no permanence. If the divine and the human were different, there could be no continuity [between them].",
        explanation: "Like a ball rolling over a hill it shouldn't, particles tunnel through barriers in quantum physics. Similarly, humans might transcend to the divine, but it's not a simple, separate path. This quantum tunneling symbolizes transcendence of dualities, suggesting a non-classical link between different states.",
        title: "Transcending Dualities"
    },
    {
        number: "Verse 17",
        text: "If one part were divine and one part were human, there would be both permanence and no permanence. But that is not reasonable.",
        explanation: "Imagine water freezing into ice—it's not half-liquid, half-solid; it's a new state. A being can't be half-divine, half-human; it's an unreasonable mix. This is like a Bose-Einstein condensate at near absolute zero, where atoms behave as a single quantum entity, neither fully particle nor wave, challenging classical distinctions.",
        title: "Unreasonable Dualities"
    },
    {
        number: "Verse 18",
        text: "If both permanence and impermanence were established, you would have to assert non-permanence and non-impermanence as established.",
        explanation: "Like a spinning coin neither heads nor tails mid-air, quantum states are in-between. The self isn't just permanent or impermanent—it's beyond such labels. Quantum superpositions and entangled states defy classical categories, existing in a state that isn't simply 'this or that,' akin to emptiness transcending dualities.",
        title: "Beyond Categories"
    },
    {
        number: "Verse 19",
        text: "If something came from somewhere and went somewhere, then samsara would be without beginning. That is not the case.",
        explanation: "Picture a leaky bucket—water (samsara) doesn't last forever; it drains out. Even cycles of existence might end, not stretching infinitely. This parallels Hawking radiation, where black holes evaporate over time, suggesting even seemingly eternal structures have finite lifespans, challenging the concept of endless samsara.",
