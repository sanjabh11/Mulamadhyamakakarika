        accessibleExplanation: "Good actions are like planting seeds, growing into positive outcomes, dependent on conditions."

        text: "The great sage has taught all actions to be intention and what is intended. The specifics of those actions are well known to be of many kinds.",

        quantumParallel: "Measurement in quantum mechanics: Intention leads to outcomes, fitting action-intention dynamics.",

        quantumParallel: "Wave function and measurement: Intention as wave function, physical action as measurement outcome.",
        accessibleExplanation: "Thoughts are like quantum possibilities, actions their realization, similar to measuring a wave function."

        number: 6,
        text: "If the action remained until the time of ripening, it would become permanent. If it stopped, by having stopped, how could a fruit be born?",
        madhyamakaConcept: "Actions are impermanent, yet their effects persist through dependent origination, avoiding eternalism or annihilationism.",
        quantumParallel: "Wave function evolution: Past actions influence future states, showing temporal continuity.",
        accessibleExplanation: "Think of a seed growing into a plant—actions have effects that carry forward, like a quantum wave changing over time."

        quantumParallel: "Quantum tunneling: Particles pass barriers, reflecting the causal chain.",
        accessibleExplanation: "Seeds lead to fruits like a ball rolling through a tunnel—causes produce effects without a fixed essence."

    {
        number: 8,
        text: "Because continuums are from seeds and fruits emerge from continuums and seeds precede fruits, therefore, there is no annihilation and no permanence.",

        quantumParallel: "Quantum entanglement: Interconnected states reflect the continuum.",
        accessibleExplanation: "Seeds and fruits form a chain, like entangled particles affecting each other, neither permanent nor gone."

        text: "The continuum of mind clearly emerges from mind, and from that fruits. If there were no mind, they too would not emerge.",

        quantumParallel: "Quantum state evolution: Mental states shape outcomes, like mind-body links.",
        accessibleExplanation: "Your thoughts lead to actions, like a wave turning into a specific state, showing mind's role in reality."

        quantumParallel: "Wave function evolution: Mental continuums influence fruits over time.",
        accessibleExplanation: "Thoughts lead to results, like evolving quantum waves, neither fixed nor disappearing."
