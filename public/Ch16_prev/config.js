        title: "Verse 1: Emptiness of Samsara",
        madhyamakaConcept: "Emptiness of samsara through tetralemma, neither permanent nor impermanent",
        quantumParallel: "Superposition, particle in multiple states until measured",
        accessibleExplanation: "Picture a gift box that could hold a book, a toy, or nothing—until you open it, it's all of those things at once. Similarly, samsara isn't fixed as permanent or impermanent; it's our perception that defines it.",
        interactionHint: "Click to collapse the wave function"
    },
    {
        id: 2,
        title: "Verse 2: No-self Doctrine",
        madhyamakaConcept: "No-self doctrine, person dependent on aggregates",
        quantumParallel: "Entanglement, particles interconnected without independent existence",
        accessibleExplanation: "Think of two best friends who always know what the other is thinking, like they're linked. The self is like that— not a solo thing, but a mix of thoughts, feelings, and experiences tied together.",
        interactionHint: "Click one particle to measure its state"
    },
    {
        id: 3,
        title: "Verse 3: Emptiness of Clinging",
        madhyamakaConcept: "Emptiness of clinging and becoming, no inherent entity",
        quantumParallel: "Measurement problem, measurement determines state like clinging",
        accessibleExplanation: "Imagine staring at a blurry photo: focusing on it (like measuring) makes it sharp, but it's still just an image. Clinging works the same way—it creates a sense of self, but there's no solid 'you' there.",
        interactionHint: "Click to collapse the wave"
    },
    {
        id: 4,
        title: "Verse 4: Inherent Constraints in Samsara",
        madhyamakaConcept: "Inherent constraints in samsara, misery inescapable from inherent view",
        quantumParallel: "Uncertainty principle, limits in knowing properties",
        accessibleExplanation: "It's like trying to grab a wet bar of soap—the harder you squeeze, the more it slips. In samsara, suffering sticks around because we can't fully control or escape it.",
        interactionHint: "Adjust sliders to see uncertainty principle"
    },
    {
        id: 5,
        title: "Verse 5: Emptiness of Bondage and Freedom",
        madhyamakaConcept: "Emptiness of bondage and freedom, neither bound nor freed ultimately",
        quantumParallel: "Quantum indeterminacy, particle neither in one state nor another",
        accessibleExplanation: "Imagine flipping a coin in the air—it's neither heads nor tails until it lands. Similarly, we're not truly bound or free until we label it that way.",
        interactionHint: "Click to collapse the superposition"
    },
    {
        id: 6,
        title: "Verse 6: Ambiguity of Subject-Object",
        madhyamakaConcept: "Ambiguity of subject-object in clinging, both empty",
        quantumParallel: "Wave function collapse, measurement blurs observer-observed",
        accessibleExplanation: "Think of taking a selfie: the moment you snap it, you change the scene by being in it. In samsara, grasping at things makes them seem real, but both you and the 'thing' are empty.",
        interactionHint: "Click to observe and collapse the wave"
    },
    {
        id: 7,
        title: "Verse 7: Interdependence Without Temporal Precedence",
        madhyamakaConcept: "Interdependence without temporal precedence, binding and bound co-arise",
        quantumParallel: "Entanglement, correlation without temporal order",
        accessibleExplanation: "Picture two dancers moving perfectly in sync—no one leads, they just flow together. Binding and being bound in samsara are like that, happening together without a 'first step.'",
        interactionHint: "Click one particle to measure both instantly"
    },
    {
        id: 8,
        title: "Verse 8: Paradox of Bondage and Freedom",
        madhyamakaConcept: "Paradox of bondage and freedom, both empty of inherent existence",
        quantumParallel: "Superposition, system in multiple states simultaneously",
        accessibleExplanation: "Imagine a cat in a box, alive and dead until you check. Similarly, we can be seen as bound and free at the same time—until we decide, it's all empty.",
        interactionHint: "Click to collapse superposition state"
    },
    {
        id: 9,
        title: "Verse 9: Grasping at Non-grasping",
        madhyamakaConcept: "Grasping at non-grasping, attachment to non-attachment",
        quantumParallel: "Quantum Zeno effect, frequent measurement reinforces state",
        accessibleExplanation: "It's like watching a pot to see if it'll boil—keep checking, and it won't. Trying hard to let go of clinging can turn into a new kind of clinging.",
        interactionHint: "Click repeatedly to freeze the particle's state"
    },
    {
        id: 10,
        title: "Verse 10: Conventional Nature of Samsara and Nirvana",
        madhyamakaConcept: "Conventional nature of samsara and nirvana, dependent on perspective",
        quantumParallel: "Quantum contextuality, measurement outcomes depend on context",
        accessibleExplanation: "Think of a prism: tilt it one way, you see red; another, blue. Samsara and nirvana are like that—what you see depends on how you look at reality.",
        interactionHint: "Click different axes to measure spin"
