            madhyamakaText: "The rejection of inherent existence (svabhava) is a fundamental principle in Madhyamaka philosophy, asserting that phenomena lack fixed, independent essence.",
            quantumText: "The Copenhagen interpretation suggests particles have no definite properties until measured, existing in probabilistic states rather than fixed realities.",
            rationale: "Both challenge fixed, inherent properties: Madhyamaka denies intrinsic existence, while the Copenhagen view shows particles lack definite states until observed.",

            title: "Four Types of Conditions",
            madhyamakaText: "Madhyamaka describes four types of conditions that give rise to phenomena, emphasizing interdependent factors rather than linear causation.",
            quantumText: "Feynman diagrams visualize multiple possible interaction pathways between particles, showing complex relationships rather than simple cause-effect.",
            rationale: "Both highlight multiple interdependent factors: Madhyamaka's conditions and Feynman diagrams show outcomes arising from complex interactions.",

            madhyamakaText: "Madhyamaka asserts that conditions themselves lack the inherent power to produce effects, challenging deterministic causality.",
            quantumText: "Quantum mechanics reveals that outcomes are fundamentally probabilistic, not deterministic, with identical conditions yielding different results.",
            rationale: "Both reject deterministic causality: Madhyamaka denies inherent production, while quantum mechanics shows outcomes are probabilistic, not fixed.",

            madhyamakaText: "Madhyamaka rejects any substantial link between causes and effects, seeing them as merely conventionally designated.",
            quantumText: "Quantum entanglement demonstrates correlations between particles without direct causal mechanisms, challenging classical notions of causality.",
            rationale: "Both emphasize non-local correlations: Madhyamaka rejects substantial causal links, while entanglement shows instant correlations without direct causation.",

            quantumText: "Quantum measurement causes instantaneous state changes, with wave function collapse occurring non-linearly across space-time.",

            quantumText: "The quantum vacuum, though 'empty' of particles, teems with virtual particle activity and field fluctuations.",
            rationale: "Both portray 'emptiness' as dynamic: Madhyamaka's emptiness is interdependent, while the quantum vacuum teems with virtual particle activity.",
