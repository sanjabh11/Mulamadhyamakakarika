            title: "Interdependence of Actor and Act",
            text: "Neither actor nor act has inherent existence; they arise interdependently.",
            quantumConcept: "Quantum Entanglement",
            explanation: "Just as entangled particles share correlated states regardless of distance, actors and acts cannot be separated. When measuring one entangled particle, the other instantly adopts a correlated state, demonstrating their fundamental interconnection.",
            metaphor: "Like dancers in a duet who rely on each other's movements to create a coherent performance, actor and act exist only in relation to one another.",

            title: "Absurdity of Inherent Existence",
            text: "The absurdity of inherent existence is revealed; actor and act dependently arise.",
            quantumConcept: "Quantum Superposition",
            explanation: "In quantum superposition, particles exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured. Similarly, both actor and act exist in an indeterminate state where neither has fixed properties until they interact.",
            metaphor: "Like Schr√∂dinger's cat, both alive and dead until observed, the actor-act relationship exists in multiple potential states until manifested.",

            title: "Conventional Existence Through Dependence",
            text: "This rejects nihilism; conventional existence arises through dependence.",
            quantumConcept: "Wave Function Probability",
            explanation: "Quantum wave functions represent probabilistic existence, like the electron in the double-slit experiment. Though no definite position exists until measured, patterns of probability emerge over time.",
            metaphor: "Like individual raindrops falling randomly but collectively forming puddles, actions and agents have conventional existence through patterns of dependence.",

            title: "Dependent Origination",
            text: "Emphasizes dependent origination; causes and effects are interdependent.",
            quantumConcept: "Path Integral Formulation",
            explanation: "In quantum mechanics, the path integral sums over all possible paths a particle might take. Rather than a single definitive trajectory, reality emerges from the interference of all possibilities.",
            metaphor: "Like a traveler who takes all possible routes home simultaneously, causes and effects are not fixed but emerge from countless interdependent possibilities.",

            title: "Emptiness Underpins Convention",
            text: "Without actions, no ethics or fruits; emptiness underpins convention.",
            quantumConcept: "Quantum Decoherence",
            explanation: "Decoherence explains how quantum systems interact with their environment to produce classical behavior. The quantum weirdness disappears as systems interact with their surroundings.",
            metaphor: "Like a crowd that appears chaotic at the individual level but forms orderly lines when viewed as a whole, actions lead to ethical frameworks despite their ultimate emptiness.",

            title: "Karma and Liberation",
            text: "Without fruits, liberation and activities meaningless; karma vital.",
            quantumConcept: "Statistical Interpretation",
            explanation: "The statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics shows that while individual quantum events are unpredictable, patterns emerge at scale, just as karma's effects may not be immediately obvious but manifest over time.",
            metaphor: "Like lottery draws that appear random but show statistical patterns over time, karmic outcomes may seem unpredictable but follow deeper principles.",

            title: "Middle Way on Emptiness",
            text: "Rejects both existence and non-existence; middle way on emptiness.",
            quantumConcept: "Quantum Contextuality",
            explanation: "Quantum contextuality shows that measurement outcomes depend on the context of measurement. Properties aren't fixed but emerge based on how we interact with the system.",
            metaphor: "Like how social behavior changes depending on context, quantum properties shift based on the measurement context - neither fixed nor non-existent.",

            title: "Contradictions from Inherent Existence",
            text: "Contradictions from inherent existence; reinforces interdependence.",
            quantumConcept: "Incompatible Observables",
            explanation: "Heisenberg's uncertainty principle demonstrates that incompatible observables like position and momentum cannot be simultaneously measured with precision, revealing fundamental limits to fixed properties.",
            metaphor: "Just as you cannot be both at work and at home simultaneously, particles cannot have precisely defined position and momentum - fixed properties lead to contradictions.",

            title: "Indeterminate States",
            text: "Extends to indeterminate states; actor can't perform fixed acts.",
            quantumConcept: "Quantum Indeterminacy",
            explanation: "Quantum indeterminacy shows that particles fundamentally lack definite properties until measured. An electron in an atom exists as a cloud of probability rather than a definite point.",
            metaphor: "Like a weather forecast that remains uncertain until the day arrives, actor and act exist in states of potential rather than fixed reality.",

            title: "No Fixed Actor-Act Relations",
            text: "Without inherent existence, no fixed actor-act relations.",
            quantumConcept: "Quantum Coherence",
            explanation: "Quantum coherence allows systems to maintain superpositions of states, enabling quantum computers to process multiple possibilities simultaneously until measurement forces a single outcome.",
            metaphor: "Like a choir singing in perfect harmony until disturbed, quantum states maintain coherent relationships until external interaction breaks the harmony.",

            text: "Middle position; neither exists nor not, both actor and act empty.",
            quantumConcept: "Quantum Superposition of Qubits",
            explanation: "Qubits in quantum computing exist in superpositions, representing neither purely 0 nor purely 1, but probability amplitudes of both simultaneously.",
            metaphor: "Like a dimmer light switch that is neither fully on nor fully off, actor and act exist in a middle state that transcends binary categorization.",

            title: "Mutual Dependence",
            text: "Explicit mutual dependence; actor and act co-arise.",
            quantumConcept: "Quantum Field Theory",
            explanation: "In quantum field theory, particles are excitations of underlying fields - photons emerge from electromagnetic fields, showing how seemingly distinct entities arise from common foundations.",
            metaphor: "Like waves on a lake that cannot exist without water, actions cannot exist without agents and vice versa - both arise from the same interdependent reality.",

            quantumConcept: "Quantum Holism",
            explanation: "Quantum holism reveals that system properties cannot be reduced to individual parts. The whole system exhibits behaviors that transcend the sum of its components.",
            metaphor: "Just as team spirit emerges from but transcends individual players, phenomena arise from complex webs of interdependence that cannot be reduced to fixed entities.",
