        text: "The seen, the seeing, and the seer: these three do not mutually connect as pairs or all together.",
        madhyamaka: "Subject, object, action lack inherent connections, emphasizing emptiness and dependence.",
        quantum: "Measurement problem: observation affects system state, showing dependent connections.",
        explanation: "Just as observing a star changes with your perspective, measuring a quantum particle affects its state. This demonstrates that the observer, the act of observing, and what is observed are not independent but interconnected in both philosophy and quantum physics."

        title: "Verse 2",
        text: "Likewise desire, desiring and the desired, the remaining afflictions and also the remaining sense-fields do not connect by three aspects.",
        madhyamaka: "Emotions and senses lack inherent connections, all empty, reinforcing dependent origination.",
        quantum: "Entanglement: particles' states correlated instantly, mirroring non-local dependent links.",
        explanation: "Like entangled dice that affect each other's rolls instantaneously across distance, our desires and the objects of desire are interconnected through dependent origination, not existing as separate independent entities."

        id: 3,
        title: "Verse 3",
        text: "If the other connects to the other, because the seen and so forth do not exist as other, therefore there is no connection.",
        madhyamaka: "Connected things must be distinct, but distinct cannot connect inherently, all connections empty.",
        quantum: "Entanglement: distinct particles correlated, challenging classical connection notions.",
        explanation: "Quantum entanglement shows that seemingly distinct particles can be correlated in ways that challenge our intuition about connections, like two entangled coins that always flip to matching sides, demonstrating non-classical relationships."

    {
        id: 4,
        title: "Verse 4",
        text: "Not only are the seen and so forth alone not existing as other, it is invalid for anything simultaneous with something to be other than it.",
        madhyamaka: "Simultaneous things not inherently distinct, distinctions conventional, dependent on conceptualization.",
        quantum: "Quantum superposition: multiple states until measured, paralleling non-inherent distinctions.",
        explanation: "Like Schr√∂dinger's cat being both alive and dead until observed, things in our world lack fixed identities. Just as rainbow colors blend without clear boundaries, distinctions we make are conventional rather than inherent."
    },
    {
        id: 5,
        title: "Verse 5",
        text: "The other is other in dependence upon the other. Without the other, the other would not be other. It is invalid for whatever is dependent on something to be other than that.",
        madhyamaka: "Otherness relational, dependent, lacking inherent existence, emphasizing interdependence.",
        quantum: "Wave-particle duality: behavior depends on observation, mirroring dependent identity.",
        explanation: "An electron appears as either a wave or particle depending on how we observe it. Similarly, water can be still or wavy depending on our perspective, showing how identity is dependent on context rather than inherent."

    {
        id: 6,
        title: "Verse 6",
        text: "If the other was other than the other, then, without the other, it would be other. Without the other it would not be other. Therefore, it does not exist.",
        madhyamaka: "Otherness paradoxical, relies on another, not inherent but dependent, leading to emptiness.",
        quantum: "Quantum contextuality: outcomes depend on other measurements, showing context-dependent properties.",
        explanation: "In quantum physics, measurement results can vary depending on what else is being measured, like answers changing based on the questions asked. This mirrors the philosophical idea that 'otherness' is not inherent but dependent on context."

    {
        id: 7,
        title: "Verse 7",
        text: "Otherness does not exist in the other. Nor does it exist in what is not other. If otherness does not exist, neither the other nor that itself exists.",
        madhyamaka: "Otherness not inherent in anything, \"other\" and \"not other\" empty, interdependent concepts.",
        quantum: "Measurement problem: observer and observed linked by measurement, paralleling lack of inherent distinctions.",
        explanation: "When we measure a particle's position, we affect its momentum, showing interconnection. Similarly, our mood can color how we see the world, demonstrating that distinctions between self and other are not fixed but interdependent."
    },
    {
        id: 8,
        title: "Verse 8",
        text: "That does not connect with that. The other too does not connect with the other. The connecting, the connection and the connector too do not exist.",
        madhyamaka: "Nothing connects inherently, connections, acts, agents empty, aligning with rejection of inherent relations.",
        quantum: "Entanglement swapping: particles connected indirectly, showing non-classical dependent links.",
        explanation: "Just as two people can be linked through a mutual friend without ever meeting, particles can become entangled indirectly through entanglement swapping. This shows that connections aren't fixed properties but arise through interdependence."
