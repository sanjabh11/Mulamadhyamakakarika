        verseText: "Those views such as 'I occurred or did not occur in the past,' 'the world is permanent,' are dependent on the extreme of Before.",
        madhyamakaConcept: "Nagarjuna challenges views asserting an inherently existent past self or world, arguing they rely on the extreme of intrinsic existence. This aligns with emptiness (shunyata), where phenomena lack independent essence and arise dependently. The critique targets reified notions of time and identity.",
        quantumParallel: "Quantum superposition: Particles exist in multiple potential states simultaneously until observed, lacking a definite state. This mirrors the indeterminacy of past existence, as no fixed 'before' can be pinned down without conditions collapsing the state.",
        accessibleExplanation: "Imagine wondering if you locked the door earlier—you can't be sure without checking. Similarly, whether your past self existed isn't fixed; it depends on conditions, not an inherent truth, much like a quantum state waiting to be measured.",

        madhyamakaConcept: "Extends the critique to future-oriented views, rejecting inherent existence of a future self or world endpoint. Nagarjuna emphasizes dependent origination, where phenomena lack a fixed future essence, undermining eternalist or nihilist extremes.",
        quantumParallel: "Quantum mechanics' probabilistic nature: Future states of particles are predicted as probabilities, not certainties, until measurement occurs. This parallels the non-fixed nature of future self-existence, reliant on present conditions.",
        accessibleExplanation: "Think of a weather forecast—it's just a chance of rain, not a guarantee. Your future self is like that: not set in stone, but a possibility shaped by what's happening now, not an inherent 'later.'",

        verseNumber: 3,
        verseText: "It is incorrect to say: 'I occurred at a time in the past.' Whatever occurred before, that is not this.",
        madhyamakaConcept: "Challenges the continuity of self-identity from past to present, resonating with anatta (no-self). Nagarjuna argues the self is a flux of changing aggregates, not a persistent entity, rejecting fixed identity over time.",
        quantumParallel: "Particle indistinguishability: In quantum mechanics, particles like electrons lack unique identities, interchangeable within systems. This parallels the non-persistent, aggregate-based self lacking inherent sameness.",
        accessibleExplanation: "Picture identical twins swapping places—you can't tell who's who. Your past self isn't 'you' now; it's a different mix of traits, linked but not the same, like indistinguishable particles.",

        madhyamakaConcept: "If the self is identical to impermanent aggregates, it too is impermanent, contradicting notions of a permanent self. This reinforces emptiness, as no stable essence endures amidst change.",
        quantumParallel: "Quantum decoherence: A quantum system loses its coherent state through environmental interaction, akin to the self's impermanence as aggregates shift and dissolve over time.",

        madhyamakaConcept: "Aggregates (e.g., body, mind) are impermanent and cannot be the self, as they arise and cease. This highlights interdependence—neither self nor aggregates are independent—pointing to emptiness.",
        quantumParallel: "Observer effect: Measuring a quantum state alters it, showing interdependence between observer and observed, much like the self and aggregates influencing each other.",

        madhyamakaConcept: "If the self is distinct from aggregates, it lacks a basis for existence, as nothing independent is apprehensible. This negates a separate self, reinforcing emptiness beyond identity or difference.",
        quantumParallel: "Uncertainty principle: Position and momentum cannot be precisely known together, mirroring the self's elusive nature—ungraspable when separated from aggregates.",

        madhyamakaConcept: "The self transcends dualities—neither identical to nor different from aggregates, nor simply their absence or nothingness. This tetralemma points to emptiness, beyond conceptual extremes.",

        madhyamakaConcept: "Rejects the view that the past self didn't exist, emphasizing continuity through dependent origination. The present self is linked to the past, not wholly separate, undermining nihilism.",
        quantumParallel: "Quantum entanglement: Particles remain connected across time and space, their states correlated, paralleling the interconnectedness of past and present selves.",
        accessibleExplanation: "Imagine two friends so in sync they finish each other's sentences. Your past and present selves are linked like that—not separate, but tied together across time.",

        quantumParallel: "Non-locality: Quantum actions influence distant outcomes instantly, challenging classical separation, akin to the non-classical link between past and present selves.",
