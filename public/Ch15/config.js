        originalVerse: "It is unreasonable for an essence to arise from causes and conditions. Whatever essence arose from causes and conditions would be something that has been made.",
        madhyamakaConcept: "Essence, by definition, is intrinsic and independent. If it arises from causes, it is dependent and fabricated, contradicting its definition.",
        quantumParallel: "Wave function collapse shows properties are determined upon measurement, not inherent, similar to essences being \"made.\"",
        accessibleExplanation: "Quantum particles lack fixed properties until measured, like a box revealing its content only when opened."

        originalVerse: "How is it possible for there to be 'an essence which has been made?' Essences are not contrived and not dependent on anything else.",
        madhyamakaConcept: "The notion of a fabricated essence is incoherent because essences are supposed to be uncontrived and independent.",
        quantumParallel: "Identical particles in quantum mechanics are indistinguishable, lacking unique properties, suggesting no inherent essence.",
        accessibleExplanation: "Quantum particles are like identical twins with no individual identities, indicating the absence of inherent essence."

        originalVerse: "If an essence does not exist, how can the thingness of the other exist? For the essence of the thingness of the other is said to be the thingness of the other.",
        madhyamakaConcept: "Without inherent essence, relational identities also collapse, as they depend on the notion of essence.",
        quantumParallel: "Quantum entanglement demonstrates that particles' states are interdependent, not inherent.",

        madhyamakaConcept: "Without essence or relational identity, things lack inherent establishment; they are empty.",

        madhyamakaConcept: "Without inherent things, the concept of non-things also does not hold. Change implies impermanence, not inherent existence.",
        quantumParallel: "Particle creation and annihilation show that particles are not permanent; they can come into and out of existence.",

        madhyamakaConcept: "If things had inherent essence, they would be permanent and unchanging, but since they change, they lack essence.",
        quantumParallel: "Radioactive decay illustrates that particles can transform, indicating they lack a fixed essence.",
        accessibleExplanation: "Particles can change form, similar to ice melting into water, showing they do not have an unchanging essence."

        madhyamakaConcept: "Both the existence and non-existence of essences lead to the impossibility of change, yet change occurs, implying emptiness.",
        quantumParallel: "Quantum particles lack definite trajectories, suggesting they do not have a fixed essence over time.",

        madhyamakaConcept: "The wise avoid the extremes of eternalism and nihilism, understanding the Middle Way.",
        quantumParallel: "Superposition embodies states that are beyond binary existence or non-existence.",

        madhyamakaConcept: "This verse explains the extremes of eternalism and nihilism, both of which are rejected in favor of the Middle Way.",
        quantumParallel: "The conservation of quantum information indicates that while states transform, the information persists, avoiding both permanence and annihilation.",
        accessibleExplanation: "Similar to translating a book where the content changes form but is not lost, quantum information is preserved through transformations."
