    text: "If there were nothing permanent at all, what thing could be impermanent, permanent and impermanent, free of both?",
    madhyamaka: "Without any continuity (misinterpreted as permanence), concepts like impermanence lose meaning. This highlights dependent origination, where phenomena arise interdependently.",
    quantum: "Quantum coherence: Maintains quantum states over time, providing continuity essential for quantum systems, akin to continuity needed for meaningful existence.",
    accessible: "Like a song needing a steady beat to make sense, the self needs some continuity to exist, but it's not fixed—it's a flow, not a static thing.",
    title: "Continuity in Change",
    animation: "quantumCoherence"
  },
  {
    number: 21,
    text: "If this world had an end, how would the next world come to be? If this world had no end, how would the next world come to be?",
    madhyamaka: "Both finite and infinite world views lead to problems: a finite world can't birth another, and an infinite one has no room for succession. This points to emptiness beyond conceptual limits.",
    quantum: "Loop quantum gravity: Suggests the universe cycles through births and deaths, challenging classical notions of beginning and end, akin to samsara's complex nature.",
    accessible: "Imagine a loop of string—no clear start or end. The universe might cycle without a definite \"next\" world, making simple end or no-end views insufficient.",
    title: "World's Continuity",
    animation: "cyclicUniverse"
  },

    number: 22,
    text: "Because the continuity of the aggregates is similar to the light of a lamp, therefore the very existence or non-existence of an end is unreasonable.",
    madhyamaka: "Aggregates' continuity is like a lamp's light—dependent on causes, with no inherent start or finish. Debating an absolute end or no-end is misguided, pointing to emptiness.",
    quantum: "Quantum field theory: Fields are continuous, with particles as excitations, lacking clear beginnings or ends, mirroring the dependent nature of phenomena.",
    accessible: "A lamp's light seems steady, but it's fueled by electricity. The world's existence is ongoing but conditional, not inherently endless or finite.",
    title: "Dependent Continuity",
    animation: "quantumField"
  },
  {
    number: 23,
    text: "If the former perished and that [future] aggregate did not arise in dependence upon this aggregate, then this world would have an end.",
    madhyamaka: "If past aggregates don't condition future ones, the world would cease, as there's no continuity. This reinforces dependent origination, where each moment conditions the next.",
    quantum: "Quantum teleportation: Information transfers without physical movement, suggesting continuity through non-local means, akin to aggregates influencing future states.",
    accessible: "Like emailing a photo—it's not the same pixels, but the image persists. Aggregates pass on influence without being the same \"thing.\"",

    animation: "quantumTeleportation"
  },
  {
    number: 24,
    text: "If the former did not perish and that [future] aggregate did not arise in dependence upon this aggregate, then this world would not have an end.",
    madhyamaka: "If aggregates are permanent and future ones don't depend on them, the world is static, with no end or change—contradicting impermanence and dependent origination.",
    quantum: "Topological quantum states: Exhibit stability despite local changes, akin to a permanent world, but quantum systems evolve, reflecting impermanence.",
    accessible: "A knot stays tied even if you shake the rope, but the rope frays. Some stability exists, but change is inevitable, not permanent.",
    title: "Stability vs. Change",
    animation: "topologicalStates"
  },
  {
    number: 25,
    text: "If one part had an end and one part did not have an end, the world would be with and without an end. That too is unreasonable.",
    madhyamaka: "A world partly finite and partly infinite is contradictory, as it can't coherently be both. This points to the emptiness of such dualistic views.",
    quantum: "Wave-particle duality: Light acts as both a wave (continuous) and particle (discrete), defying either-or categorization, like the world can't be just finite or infinite.",
    accessible: "A puzzle is complete and has edges, but the image can continue beyond. Reality defies simple categories of having limits or not.",
