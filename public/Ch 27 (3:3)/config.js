    text: "If there were nothing permanent at all, what thing could be impermanent, permanent and impermanent, free of both?",
    madhyamaka: "Without any continuity (misinterpreted as permanence), concepts like impermanence lose meaning. This highlights dependent origination, where phenomena arise interdependently.",
    quantum: "Quantum coherence: Maintains quantum states over time, providing continuity essential for quantum systems, akin to continuity needed for meaningful existence.",
    accessible: "Like a song needing a steady beat to make sense, the self needs some continuity to exist, but it's not fixed—it's a flow, not a static thing.",

  {
    number: 21,
    text: "If this world had an end, how would the next world come to be? If this world had no end, how would the next world come to be?",
    madhyamaka: "Both finite and infinite world views lead to problems: a finite world can't birth another, and an infinite one has no room for succession. This points to emptiness beyond conceptual limits.",
    quantum: "Loop quantum gravity: Suggests the universe cycles through births and deaths, challenging classical notions of beginning and end, akin to samsara's complex nature.",
    accessible: "Imagine a loop of string—no clear start or end. The universe might cycle without a definite \"next\" world, making simple end or no-end views insufficient.",

  },
  {
    number: 22,
    text: "Because the continuity of the aggregates is similar to the light of a lamp, therefore the very existence or non-existence of an end is unreasonable.",
    madhyamaka: "Aggregates' continuity is like a lamp's light—dependent on causes, with no inherent start or finish. Debating an absolute end or no-end is misguided, pointing to emptiness.",
    quantum: "Quantum field theory: Fields are continuous, with particles as excitations, lacking clear beginnings or ends, mirroring the dependent nature of phenomena.",
    accessible: "A lamp's light seems steady, but it's fueled by electricity. The world's existence is ongoing but conditional, not inherently endless or finite.",
    title: "Dependent Continuity",
    animation: "quantumField"

    number: 23,
    text: "If the former perished and that [future] aggregate did not arise in dependence upon this aggregate, then this world would have an end.",
    madhyamaka: "If past aggregates don't condition future ones, the world would cease, as there's no continuity. This reinforces dependent origination, where each moment conditions the next.",
    quantum: "Quantum teleportation: Information transfers without physical movement, suggesting continuity through non-local means, akin to aggregates influencing future states.",
    accessible: "Like emailing a photo—it's not the same pixels, but the image persists. Aggregates pass on influence without being the same \"thing.\"",

  {

    text: "If the former did not perish and that [future] aggregate did not arise in dependence upon this aggregate, then this world would not have an end.",
    madhyamaka: "If aggregates are permanent and future ones don't depend on them, the world is static, with no end or change—contradicting impermanence and dependent origination.",
    quantum: "Topological quantum states: Exhibit stability despite local changes, akin to a permanent world, but quantum systems evolve, reflecting impermanence.",
    accessible: "A knot stays tied even if you shake the rope, but the rope frays. Some stability exists, but change is inevitable, not permanent.",
    title: "Stability vs. Change",
    animation: "topologicalStates"
  },

    number: 25,
    text: "If one part had an end and one part did not have an end, the world would be with and without an end. That too is unreasonable.",
    madhyamaka: "A world partly finite and partly infinite is contradictory, as it can't coherently be both. This points to the emptiness of such dualistic views.",
    quantum: "Quantum fractals: Exhibit self-similarity at all scales, defying simple finite or infinite labels, mirroring the world's complex nature beyond end or no-end.",
    accessible: "A coastline looks jagged whether you zoom in or out—it's neither finite nor infinite simply. The world's nature is similarly complex, not just \"with end\" or \"without.\"",

  {
    number: 26,
    text: "How can one part of the one-who-clings perish while one part does not perish? Likewise, that is unreasonable.",
    madhyamaka: "The self (one-who-clings) cannot have parts that perish and parts that don't, as it's a unified concept. This reinforces the non-dual nature of the self in emptiness.",
    quantum: "Quantum entanglement: Entangled particles are interlinked; changing one affects the whole, not just parts, akin to the self's unified nature.",
    accessible: "Like a team where one player's injury affects everyone's performance, the self's \"parts\" are interconnected—perishing in one affects all.",

    animation: "quantumEntanglement"
  },
  {
    number: 27,
    text: "How can one part of that-which-is-clung-to perish while one part does not perish? Likewise, that is unreasonable.",
    madhyamaka: "Aggregates (that-which-is-clung-to) are interdependent; one part's perishing affects the whole, making isolated perishing unreasonable, reinforcing emptiness.",
    quantum: "Quantum error correction: Information is distributed across a system, so partial failures don't collapse the whole, paralleling aggregates' resilience through interdependence.",
    accessible: "Like a hologram where each piece contains the whole image, aggregates support each other—perishing in one part doesn't destroy the system.",
    title: "Interdependent Aggregates",
    animation: "quantumErrorCorrection"
  },
  {
    number: 28,
    text: "If both the presence and absence of an end were established, you would have to assert non-presence and non-absence as established.",
    madhyamaka: "Establishing both presence and absence of an end requires a third category (neither), which is logically inconsistent, pointing to emptiness beyond such extremes.",
    quantum: "Quantum logic gates: Operate on superpositions, allowing states neither 0 nor 1, transcending classical binary logic, akin to emptiness beyond presence/absence.",
    accessible: "Like a light dimmer neither fully on nor off, quantum states exist in between. The world's end isn't just \"yes\" or \"no\"—it's beyond such labels.",

    animation: "quantumLogicGates"
  },
  {
    number: 29,
    text: "And because all things are empty, about what and in whom do views such as that of permanence spring forth?",
    madhyamaka: "Since all phenomena are empty of inherent existence, views like permanence have no basis—they arise from ignorance, not from any real ground.",
    quantum: "Quantum vacuum: Even \"empty\" space teems with virtual particles, but these aren't inherently existent, paralleling how views arise from emptiness, not substance.",
    accessible: "Like mirages in a desert, views of permanence seem real but have no solid basis. They're projections of the mind, not reflections of true reality.",

    text: "I bow down to Gautama, whose kindness holds one close, who revealed the sublime dharma in order to let go of all views.",
    madhyamaka: "Nagarjuna honors the Buddha, who taught the Dharma to free beings from all views, underscoring liberation through realizing emptiness.",
    quantum: "Quantum enlightenment (metaphor): Quantum theory revolutionized physics by letting go of classical certainties, like the Dharma invites letting go of fixed views for deeper truth.",
    accessible: "Like upgrading from a flip phone to a smartphone, letting go of old views opens new possibilities. The Buddha's teaching frees the mind from rigid beliefs.",
