        quantumParallel: "Quantum Entanglement Again: States are correlated, not caused by self or other classically.",
        accessibleExplanation: "Picture two dancers moving in sync. Neither leads—they just match each other. In quantum physics, entangled particles are linked without one causing the other, and in Buddhism, remaining isn't caused by one thing alone.",

        quantumParallel: "Quantum State Transitions: States shift without a fixed end, like non-ceasing.",
        accessibleExplanation: "Imagine a traffic light turning yellow. It's not green anymore, but it hasn't \"stopped\" being green in a solid way—it's just changed. In quantum physics, states transition, and in Buddhism, cessation isn't a hard stop.",

        quantumParallel: "Quantum State Superposition: States coexist, not ending each other directly.",
        accessibleExplanation: "Picture two roommates sharing a space. One doesn't kick the other out—they just live together. In quantum physics, states overlap without one stopping the other, and in Buddhism, things end together, not separately.",

        accessibleExplanation: "Picture chopping off a head that isn't there. It's impossible. In quantum physics, the vacuum spawns and ends particles without being a \"thing,\" and in Buddhism, cessation isn't solid either.",

        quantumParallel: "Quantum Causality: Events are probabilistic, not self- or other-caused, like cessation.",
        accessibleExplanation: "Think of deciding to walk with no clear reason—just because. In quantum physics, things happen by chance, not strict cause, and in Buddhism, ending isn't pinned to one source.",
