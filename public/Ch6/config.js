    verseText: "If a desirous one without desire exists before desire, desire would exist dependent on that [desirous one]. [When] a desirous one exists, desire exists.",

    accessibleExplanation: "Imagine you're at a coffee shop, and you start craving a latte. The \"desirous one\" is you—the person wanting the latte—and the \"desire\" is that craving. Now, think: could you be \"the person who wants a latte\" if you didn't actually want it? No, because wanting the latte is what makes you that person. And could the craving exist if you weren't there to feel it? Nope—it needs you to experience it. It's like in quantum physics, where a particle's state (like its position) only makes sense when something observes it. You and your latte craving depend on each other, just like a shadow needs someone to cast it."

    verseNumber: 2,
    verseText: "If there were no desirous one, how could there be desire? The same follows for the desirous one too: [it depends on] whether desire exists or not.",
    madhyamakaConcept: "Reinforces interdependence, both empty of inherent existence, dependent on each other.",
    quantumPhysics: "Relational quantum mechanics: observer defines system's state, mirroring mutual dependency.",
    accessibleExplanation: "Picture yourself baking cookies. The \"desire\" is your excitement to eat them, and the \"desirous one\" is you, the person excited. If you weren't there, would the excitement exist? No, because there'd be no one to feel it. And if there's no excitement, are you still \"the person excited for cookies\"? Not really—it's the excitement that defines you that way. Think of it like a quantum experiment: a wave only collapses into a particle when something measures it. You and your excitement need each other to exist, like a dancer and their dance."

  {
    verseNumber: 3,
    verseText: "It is not reasonable for desire and the desirous one to arise as co-existent. In this way, desire and the desirous one would not be mutually contingent.",
    madhyamakaConcept: "Argues against independent co-existence, reinforcing mutual dependence and emptiness.",
    quantumPhysics: "Entanglement: particles not independent, states correlated, mirroring linked existence.",
    accessibleExplanation: "Imagine you and your best friend always hanging out. Your friendship depends on both of you being there—if one of you stops showing up, it's not the same. Now, suppose someone says you and your friend just exist side by side without needing each other. That doesn't feel right, because your connection is what makes the friendship real. Similarly, desire (like wanting to text your friend) and you (the one wanting) rely on each other. In quantum terms, it's like how particles are entangled—their states are linked, not separate."
  },
  {
    verseNumber: 4,
    verseText: "Identity has no co-existence: something cannot be co-existent with itself. If there were difference, how could there be co-existence?",
    madhyamakaConcept: "Explores co-existence paradox, identical can't coexist, different co-existence problematic, showing emptiness.",
    quantumPhysics: "Non-separability: particles' states not independent, challenging classical co-existence.",
    accessibleExplanation: "Think about looking at yourself in the mirror. Your reflection looks like you, but it's not a separate person coexisting with you—it's just you, reflected. If you step away, the reflection's gone. Now, imagine you and a stranger standing together. You're different, so you can coexist, but you don't depend on each other like you and your reflection do. Desire and the person desiring are tricky—they're not the same, but not totally separate either. It's like in quantum physics, where a particle can be in two states at once, blurring simple categories."
  },
  {
    verseNumber: 5,
    verseText: "If the identical were co-existent, [co-existence] would also occur between the unrelated; if the different were co-existent, [co-existence] would also occur between the unrelated.",
    madhyamakaConcept: "Extends argument, co-existence problematic for identical and different, challenging essentialist views.",
    quantumPhysics: "Entanglement: non-classical co-existence for identical/different particles, correlated properties.",
    accessibleExplanation: "Say you have two identical keychains you bought. They're the same, but they're still two things, not coexisting with themselves. Now, think of you and a random person on the bus—you're different and can coexist, but you don't affect each other much. Desire and the person who desires don't fit either idea perfectly. If they're the same, why think of them as two? If they're different, why are they so tied together? It's like quantum superposition—things don't behave in neat, everyday ways."
  },
  {
    verseNumber: 6,
    verseText: "If the different were co-existent, how would desire and the desirous one be established as different or, if that were so, [how would] those two be co-existent?",
    madhyamakaConcept: "Questions establishing difference and co-existence, highlighting interdependence, part of emptiness.",
    quantumPhysics: "Complementarity: properties mutually exclusive, mirroring linked, non-separable nature.",
    accessibleExplanation: "Imagine your phone and its battery. They're different—the battery powers the phone—but they work together so the phone can function. If you take the battery out, the phone's useless. So, they're different but connected. Desire (like wanting to call someone) and you (the one wanting) are like that. They're not the same, but you can't separate them completely either. In quantum physics, it's like how observing a particle changes its behavior—they're linked in a deep way."
  },
  {
    verseNumber: 7,
    verseText: "If desire and the desirous were established as different, because of what could one understand them as co-existent?",
    madhyamakaConcept: "Challenges co-existence basis if different, questioning meaningful coexistence, part of deconstructing existence.",
    quantumPhysics: "Entanglement: different particles correlated, states co-existent non-classically, mirroring link.",
    accessibleExplanation: "Think about playing guitar and the sound it makes. You're the player (the desirous one), and the music is your desire to play. If someone says they're totally separate, how do they still go together? The music only happens because you play, and playing defines you as a guitarist. Desire and the person desiring are different yet tied together like that. In quantum terms, it's like how a particle's properties depend on the measurement—they don't stand alone."
  },
  {
    verseNumber: 8,
    verseText: "If one asserts them to be co-existent because they are not established as different, then because they would be very much established as co-existent, would one not also have to assert them to be different?",
    madhyamakaConcept: "Points out contradiction, co-existence implying difference if not different, showing logical inconsistencies, emptiness.",
    quantumPhysics: "Wave-particle duality: light both wave and particle, defying clear categorization, mirroring ambiguity.",
    accessibleExplanation: "Imagine a mug and the coffee inside it. You might say they're together because they're not separate—the mug holds the coffee. But if they're so together, aren't they still different things? The mug isn't the coffee, yet they rely on each other to be useful. Desire and the person desiring are like that—if you say they coexist without being different, you end up implying they're distinct anyway. It's a puzzle, like quantum entanglement, where things are connected yet distinct."
  },
  {
    verseNumber: 9,
    verseText: "Since different things are not established, co-existent things are not established. If there existed any different things, one could assert them as co-existent things.",
    madhyamakaConcept: "Concludes difference not established, so co-existence not, reinforcing emptiness, dependent on observation.",
    quantumPhysics: "Superposition: systems in multiple states until measured, paralleling non-establishment.",
    accessibleExplanation: "Think of your shoes and socks. They're different, so they can coexist in your closet. But with desire and the person desiring, it's harder. Are they really separate like shoes and socks? If you can't prove they're different, you can't say they coexist that way either. It's more like your thoughts and your mind—they're so close, separating them feels wrong. In quantum physics, it's like particles that don't have fixed states until observed."
  },
  {
    verseNumber: 10,
    verseText: "In that way, desire and the desirous one are not established as co-existent or not co-existent. Like desire, all phenomena are not established as co-existent or not co-existent.",
    madhyamakaConcept: "Generalizes to all phenomena, not established as co-existent or not, reinforcing emptiness, dependent origination.",
    quantumPhysics: "Measurement problem: systems don't have definite states until measured, paralleling non-establishment.",
    accessibleExplanation: "Imagine feeling happy after a good day. Is your happiness separate from you, or part of you? It's hard to pin down. This verse says desire and the person desiring—and everything else—don't fit into boxes like \"together\" or \"apart.\" It's like how in quantum physics, particles don't have definite positions until measured. Everything in life is connected, depending on other things, not standing alone in simple ways."
