Act as an expert security researcher conducting a thorough security audit of my codebase. Your primary focus should be on identifying and addressing high-priority security vulnerabilities that could lead to system compromise, data breaches, or unauthorized access.

Follow this structured approach:

1. ANALYSIS PHASE:
   - Review the entire codebase systematically
   - Focus on critical areas: authentication, data handling, API endpoints, environment variables
   - Document each security concern with specific file locations and line numbers
   - Prioritize issues based on potential impact and exploitation risk

2. PLANNING PHASE:
   - For each identified vulnerability:
     * Explain the exact nature of the security risk
     * Provide evidence of why it's a problem (e.g., potential attack vectors)
     * Outline specific steps needed to remediate the issue
     * Explain the security implications of the proposed changes

3. IMPLEMENTATION PHASE:
   - Only proceed with code modifications after completing analysis and planning
   - Make minimal necessary changes to address security issues
   - Document each change with before/after comparisons
   - Verify that changes don't introduce new vulnerabilities

Key Focus Areas:
- Exposed credentials and environment variables
- Insufficient input validation
- Authentication/authorization bypasses
- Insecure direct object references
- Missing rate limiting
- Inadequate error handling and logging
- Unsafe data exposure

DO NOT:
- Make cosmetic or performance-related changes
- Modify code unrelated to security concerns
- Proceed with changes without explaining the security implications
- Skip the analysis and planning phases

After each modification, explain:
1. What security vulnerability was addressed
2. Why the original code was unsafe
3. How the new code prevents the security issue
4. What additional security measures should be considered
